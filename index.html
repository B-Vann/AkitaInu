								<h2>About the Akita Inu</h2>
								<p>The Akita Inu, also known as the Japanese Akita is an ancient dog breed originating from Japan. they are classified as a bear dog and were specifically bred to protect their owners from mountain predators. they were very popular in Japan and Asia and were even used by Samurai and royalty in the 1500's. However, during wartime, the dogs were ordered to be executed to stop the spread of disease. it is believed the breed dropped to 16 Akita Inu’s total before locals and breeders managed to restore the bloodline to the 30,000+ that now exist globally </p>

								<p>This is the most common color for the Akia inu, the top of the coat will be light orange/red while their lower half will be a cream color. If there is any variation in their coat it is a clear sign it was bred with something else </p>

								<h2>All White</h2>
								<p>While not as popular as the previous two coat patterns, the all white akita inu is still an akita inu. with this color pallette it is easy to determine if the akita is purebred because the nose and other features will apear more prominent</p>

									<h3>Hachikō</h3>
									<p>There is good reason Akita Inu's are renown for their loyalty and honor. Hachikō was a Japanese Akita dog remembered for his remarkable loyalty to his owner, Hidesaburō Ueno, for whom he continued to wait for over nine years following Ueno's death. Hachikō was born on November 10, 1923, at a farm near the city of Ōdate. There now remains a statue of Hachiko honoring his loyalty to his owner</p>

								<li class="fas fa-thermometer-three-quarters">
									<h3>Temperment</h3>
									<p>Sadly, in many places, the distinction between American Akita and the Akita Inu isn’t made and both are subsequently banned due to their larger size and strength. They are very reserved and will only take a liking the few selected members of its family. They are also extremely intelligent and can become reckless if they don’t get enough exercise or mental stimulus</p>
								</li>
								<li class="fas fa-seedling">
									<h3>Size</h3>
									<p>The Akita Inu can grow fairly Large. the females are usually a few inches and pounds less but the average male Akita Inu clocks in at 26 Inches tall and 70 Pounds</p>
								</li>

																<li class="far fa-question-circle">
									<h3>Ears & Tail</h3>
									<p>If you want to know if a dog is an Akita Inu, one of the best signs is the dogs ears and tail. An Akita Inu will have triangle shaped pointed ears and their tail will be full and curled</p>
								</li>

								<li class="fas fa-utensils">
									<h3>Diet</h3>
									<p>Due to their size and genetic makeup, the Akita is best suited for a healthy balance of wet and dry food containing high amounts of protien</p>
								</li>
								<li class="fas fa-money-bill-wave">
									<h3>Aquiring an Akita Inu</h3>
									<p>You will almost never find an ad of someone selling an Akita Inu, that is becuase they are often purchased months before the litter is even born due to the extremly high demand for purebred Akitas with good genetics. there are only a handful of reputable breeders outside of Asia and the wait times can be years and cost upwards of $4000</p>
